All the endpoints are listed on the RouteController.java file, you can see all of their descriptions and what they are expected to do. 

## Running Our Test
Once all the above requirements have been met, you can run our test with the following commands: 
To check whether an endpoint is working correctly, please feel free to edit the tests on the RouteControllerTests.java file. 
When satisified run: **mvn test** or **mvn test**. To check for style **mvn checkstyle:check**

All tests on this file are expected to test whether the endpoints succeed or fail. Upon testing you'll find that no test are failing, this is due to code working as expected. 

Once you run the command you'll see a report with all tests and their status on the command line interface or which ever one you decided to use.

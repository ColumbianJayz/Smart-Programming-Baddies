# Smart-Programming-Baddies - Volunteer and Donation Coordinator

## Building and Running Local Instance
Please install the following to have this run locally:
  1. Maven 3.9.5: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Follow exact instructions as the site provides.
  2. JDK 17: This is what was used to implement the service, please make sure you use this JDK version as well: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
  3. Visual Studio Code: I used Visual Studio Code to implement the test cases and and run all command until deployment inclusive: https://code.visualstudio.com/download


All the endpoints are listed in our *Controller.java file, you can see all of their descriptions and what they are expected to do.

## Running Our Test
Once all the above requirements have been met, you can run our test with the following commands:
To check whether an endpoint is working correctly, please feel free to edit the tests on the RouteControllerTests.java file.
When satisified run: **mvn test** or **mvn test**. To check for style **mvn checkstyle:check**

All tests on this file are expected to test whether the endpoints succeed or fail. Upon testing you'll find that no test are failing, this is due to code working as expected.

Once you run the command you'll see a report with all tests and their status on the command line interface or which ever one you decided to use.

**Note that you need our sensitive firebase_DB JSON in order to properly perform local tests, however it is not needed for cloud testing. If interested, please contact us.**
